Project started in order to obtain web skills (e.g. HTML, CSS, Vue.js, Javascript, Lua).
Goal is to create a Room Reservation website.

In-progress:
  - Server side (Lua)
  - Home page:
      - Filter tab
      - Grid for properties

To-do:
  - Changing password (if forgot pasword)

Done:
  - Sign In/Up pages
  - Password validator
  - Profile page
  - Responsive design for components: (Sign Up/In, Profile, Change Password). Scales with viewport width.

Setting up project:
  - Install Vue
  - cd WebApp/frontend
  - npm run dev

  - Install Lua
  - cd WebApp/backend
  - lua server.lua

As for now there's Sign In/Up forms. Sign Up form has validations for strong password,
checks if the user is not already in the local database.
