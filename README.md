Project started in order to obtain web skills (eg. HTML, CSS, Vue.js, Javascript, Lua).
Goal is to create a Room Reservation website.

In-progress:
  - Sign In & Up page (HTML, CSS, Vue.js)
  - Server side API creation that processes login data (Lua)

To-do:
  - Strong password validator
  - Home page
  - (Still generating ideas...)

Setting up project:
  - Install Vue
  - cd WebApp/frontend/frontend
  - npm run dev

  - Install Lua
  - cd WebApp/backend
  - lua server.lua

As for now there's login box to input credentials, only one available user:
  - Username: admin; Password: 1234
  - If credentials are correct the console should output: Login successful
  - Otherwise console should output: Wrong credentials

That's it for now...
